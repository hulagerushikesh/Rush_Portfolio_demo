A professional portfolio website should have clear sections for introduction, projects, blogs, and easy navigation, and can be built effectively using lightweight frontend and minimal backend tools for scalability and ease of maintenance. Here’s a high-level, feature-rich structure for your site, recommended tech stack, and extra sections to boost impact.
Must-Have Portfolio Sections
	•	Welcome / Home Page: Includes a hero section, professional intro, headline (“Hi, I’m a developer…”), downloadable resume, core skills, and a call-to-action such as “Contact Me”.
	•	About Me: Short summary (background, skills, education, passions), with a high-quality image and fun facts/testimonials.
	•	Projects: Grid/list of work with images or demo videos, project descriptions, GitHub/live site links, tags for tech used, and outcomes/achievements.
	•	Blog: Medium-style, supports posts with images and videos to share deep-dive ideas, learnings, or tutorials.
	•	Contact: Easy forms for inquiries, clickable email and phone, plus social and GitHub/LinkedIn links.
        Resume: Will have my resume content in professional resume format shoulde be displays on the Resume section. and there should be a Download resume button. 



Extra Features to Boost Professionalism
	•	Testimonials: Social proof, short quotes from colleagues/clients.
	•	Case Studies: Deep dives into best projects, showing the process.
	•	Services: Section on what you offer (e.g., freelance work, consulting).
	•	Dark/Light Mode: User theme toggle for modern UX.
	•	Mobile Responsive: Ensures accessibility across devices.
	•	Fast Page Speed/SEO: Keep images compressed, use Next.js features.

Design and Build Steps
	•	Step 1: Sketch wireframe with navigation and main sections, focusing on clear structure and fast navigation.
	•	Step 2: Scaffold with Next.js, set up routing, build each section/page as a component.
	•	Step 3: Add Tailwind CSS and style components, ensuring responsiveness.
	•	Step 4: Build interactive/animated elements with Framer Motion for engagement.
	•	Step 5: Add blog/project data—JSON or Markdown for static, or a CMS/DB for editing.
	•	Step 6: Connect forms to an email service or backend, only if necessary.
	•	Step 7: Test across devices, optimize SEO, deploy to Vercel/Netlify, connect domain.

Step 1: Start fresh and keep commits atomic
	•	Always begin by cleaning the default template files.
	•	Tackle one section/feature at a time with clear commit messages (e.g., “feat: add project card component”).
Step 2: Scaffold routes and components
	•	Use the provided file structure.
	•	Implement static content first for all pages: Home, About, Projects, Blog, Contact.
Step 3: Add interactivity/client-side features carefully
	•	Use browser APIs or dynamic behavior only inside `useEffect` to avoid hydration errors.
	•	For any components using browser-only APIs, wrap in `useEffect` and conditionally render with `isClient` checks.
Step 4: Addressing Hydration Errors
	•	Do NOT access `window` or `document` in SSR.
	•	For any client-only modules:
	•	Use `dynamic(() => import(...), { ssr: false })` to disable SSR for that component.
	•	Use `suppressHydrationWarning` only if absolutely necessary.
	•	Always ensure server-rendered and client-rendered content is identical unless using above strategies.
Step 5: Keep styling simple
	•	Use Tailwind CSS, apply utility classes in components.
	•	Avoid CSS-in-JS unless needed for theme switching or responsive logic.
Step 6: Blog + Project Content
	•	Store blog/project data as Markdown or JSON locally for static generation.
	•	Use Next.js dynamic routing for blog detail pages.
Step 7: Forms and Submission
	•	For the Contact form, use a third-party service (e.g., Formspree, Netlify Forms) to handle submissions, avoiding backend complications.
Step 8: Finalize SEO and deployment
	•	Add `<Head>` for title/meta.
	•	Deploy on Vercel or Netlify for best DX.



Instructions (Paste in .md/.txt for Cursor)
	•	Build one feature/page at a time. Test before continuing.
	•	After every code generation, check the terminal and browser console for errors.
	•	If an error appears, paste the exact error message as a code comment.
	•	Make fixes one at a time; re-run the app after each change.
	•	On repeated errors, do not auto-loop changes—pause and analyze the root cause.
	•	Use package manager commands (npm/yarn) to check/fix dependency issues.
	•	If making significant or uncertain changes, commit and push first for version safety.


Error Reporting and Fixing Suggestions
	•	Clearly state what the last change was before the error appeared.
	•	Request the AI to explain what caused the error and suggest only one fix at a time.
	•	If new errors appear after a fix, go back to last working state and address new errors individually.
	•	For persistent or unclear errors, request the AI to:
	•	Summarize possible causes
	•	Suggest manual inspection of the related code/config/data/folder structure
	•	Recommend searching latest docs or StackOverflow for complex cases


Best Practices for Stable Building
	•	Frequently commit working states (especially after major section completions).
	•	Use error boundaries and fallback UIs for critical components.
	•	Keep feature logic simple and incrementally test features—avoid merging unrelated major changes at once.
	•	Document unresolved errors, and steps tried, as TODOs or in readme files for future context.
